# My Software Engineering Self-Study Journey

Welcome to my personal repository for self-studying software engineering! This repo serves as a collection of my learning materials, projects, and notes as I explore different areas of software development. My goal is to gain a solid foundation and practical experience through hands-on projects.

ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered

* JavaScript â€“ Adding interactivity to web pages

* Frontend Frameworks â€“ Exploring React, Vue, or other modern tools
